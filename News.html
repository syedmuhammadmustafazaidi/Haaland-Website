							Haaland is a prolific scorer of goals in a team which benefits from his considerable finishing skills, but has yet to work out how to maximise every facet of his game such as his pace and physicality outside of the penalty area. When Haaland has not scored - and fortunately for City he generally has -  he has struggled to offer anything else over 90 minutes. He is a great goalscorer who needs to evolve into a great player who scores goals. If you stop the service to Haaland, which is admittedly easier said than done, you de-weaponise him. The on-field relationship needs work at City.

The same cannot be said of Rashford, whose speed and movement is the focal point of United’s attack. He is currently a great player who is scoring goals. Rashford has made over 200 more passes over the course of 24 Premier League appearances than Haaland in his 23, highlighting the difference in how they connect with their teammates. Yes, Haaland is more of a traditional number 9 whereas Rashford plays a wide striker, but there is no doubt that while opposition coaches are finding it nearly impossible to stop either player from scoring when the service is good, Rashford needs most attention across the pitch.
